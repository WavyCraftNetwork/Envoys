# WavyEnvoys
### Warning âš 
Someone by the name of name of BajanVlogs literary copied my code and uploaded to his repository without forking it, I recommend downloading the plugin through poggit or this repository. I will be pushing updates unlike the other stolen Envoy plugon. Please read through the code before downloading his and be careful! If he added something malicious it's not my responsibility for the damage of your device. This is the original Envoys plugin designed for WavyCraftNetwork.
